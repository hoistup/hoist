# Hoist
> Hoist your application up to the cloud ☁️

Hoist provides a framework for building microservices, and easily deploying them to the cloud.

**Hoist is still in very early development.**

Specifications for implementing a Hoist Server or Client library in a language can be found in the [specs](specs/README.md) directory. [Go](https://github.com/hoistup/hoist-go) will serve as the reference implementation.
